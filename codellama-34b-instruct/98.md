## Prompt
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
```
The above is an incomplete Python code fragment. Return the complete and correct code with no additional text.
## Correct solution
```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 1
    return count
```
## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate('aBCdEf')  == 1
    assert candidate('abcdefg') == 0
    assert candidate('dBBE') == 0
    assert candidate('B')  == 0
    assert candidate('U')  == 1
    assert candidate('') == 0
    assert candidate('EEEE') == 2

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True
```
