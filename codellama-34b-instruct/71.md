## Prompt
```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
```
The above is an incomplete Python code fragment. Return the complete and correct code with no additional text.
## Correct solution
```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area
```
## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate(3, 4, 5) == 6.00, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate(1, 2, 10) == -1
    assert candidate(4, 8, 5) == 8.18
    assert candidate(2, 2, 2) == 1.73
    assert candidate(1, 2, 3) == -1
    assert candidate(10, 5, 7) == 16.25
    assert candidate(2, 6, 3) == -1

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate(1, 1, 1) == 0.43, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate(2, 2, 10) == -1
```
