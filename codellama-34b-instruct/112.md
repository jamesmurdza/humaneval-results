## Prompt
```python
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """
```
The above is an incomplete Python code fragment. Return the complete and correct code with no additional text.
## Correct solution
```python

    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])

## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    assert candidate("abcde","ae") == ('bcd',False)
    assert candidate("abcdef", "b") == ('acdef',False)
    assert candidate("abcdedcba","ab") == ('cdedc',True)
    assert candidate("dwik","w") == ('dik',False)
    assert candidate("a","a") == ('',True)
    assert candidate("abcdedcba","") == ('abcdedcba',True)
    assert candidate("abcdedcba","v") == ('abcdedcba',True)
    assert candidate("vabba","v") == ('abba',True)
    assert candidate("mamma", "mia") == ("", True)
