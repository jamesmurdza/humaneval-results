## Prompt
```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate([1,2,3])==14, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([1.0,2,3])==14, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([1,3,5,7])==84, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([1.4,4.2,0])==29, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([-2.4,1,1])==6, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    assert candidate([100,1,15,2])==10230, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([10000,10000])==200000000, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([-1.4,4.6,6.3])==75, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([-1.4,17.9,18.9,19.9])==1086, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate([0])==0, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([-1])==1, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([-1,1,0])==2, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
