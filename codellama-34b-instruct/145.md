## Prompt
```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
    order them based on their index in original list.

    For example:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([]) == []

## Unit tests
```python

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]

    assert candidate([]) == []
    assert candidate([1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3]) == [-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54]
    assert candidate([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]) == [1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    assert candidate([0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4]) == [-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
