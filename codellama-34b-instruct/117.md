## Prompt
```python
def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """

    assert candidate("Uncle sam", 3) == ["Uncle"], "Fifth test error: " + str(candidate("Uncle sam", 3))


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate("", 4) == [], "1st edge test error: " + str(candidate("", 4))
    assert candidate("a b c d e f", 1) == ["b", "c", "d", "f"], "2nd edge test error: " + str(candidate("a b c d e f", 1))
