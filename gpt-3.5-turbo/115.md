```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length

        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1

## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):


    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) == 6, "Error"
    assert candidate([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2) == 5, "Error"
    assert candidate([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) == 0, "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2) == 4, "Error"
    assert candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 9) == 2, "Error"
