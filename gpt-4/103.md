```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """

The above is an incomplete Python code fragment. Return the complete and correct code with no additional text.
## Correct solution
```python

    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """if m < n:
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):

    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
```
## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate(1, 5) == "0b11"
    assert candidate(7, 13) == "0b1010"
    assert candidate(964,977) == "0b1111001010"
    assert candidate(996,997) == "0b1111100100"
    assert candidate(560,851) == "0b1011000010"
    assert candidate(185,546) == "0b101101110"
    assert candidate(362,496) == "0b110101101"
    assert candidate(350,902) == "0b1001110010"
    assert candidate(197,233) == "0b11010111"


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate(7, 5) == -1
    assert candidate(5, 1) == -1
    assert candidate(5, 5) == "0b101"
