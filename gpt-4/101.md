```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    assert candidate("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    assert candidate("Hi, my name") == ["Hi", "my", "name"]
    assert candidate("One,, two, three, four, five, six,") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate("") == []
    assert candidate("ahmed     , gamal") == ["ahmed", "gamal"]
