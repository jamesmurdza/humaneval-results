```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:

    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2

## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate([5, -2, 1, -5]) == 0  
    assert candidate([15, -73, 14, -15]) == 1
    assert candidate([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) == 2
    assert candidate([43, -12, 93, 125, 121, 109]) == 4
    assert candidate([71, -2, -33, 75, 21, 19]) == 3


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert candidate([1]) == 0              
    assert candidate([]) == 0
