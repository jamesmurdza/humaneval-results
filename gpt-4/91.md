```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1

## Unit tests
```python
def check(candidate):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert candidate("Hello world") == 0, "Test 1"
    assert candidate("Is the sky blue?") == 0, "Test 2"
    assert candidate("I love It !") == 1, "Test 3"
    assert candidate("bIt") == 0, "Test 4"
    assert candidate("I feel good today. I will be productive. will kill It") == 2, "Test 5"
    assert candidate("You and I are going for a walk") == 0, "Test 6"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
```
